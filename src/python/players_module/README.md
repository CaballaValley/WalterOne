# Players setup
Follow the next steps to use the Skeleton player as a template for your player.

## Clone the repository

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/CaballaValley/WalterOne.git 
```

## Install dependencies
```commandline
cd WalterOne/src/python/players_module
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## .env file
We have added a `.env_example` file to the root of the project. You need to copy it and rename it to `.env`.

```commandline
cp .env_example .env
```
Then you need to fill the variables with the correct values:
```commandline
WALTERONE_HOST=192.168.1.1:1232
WALTERONE_MATCH=1

WALTERONE_USERNAME=YourUsername
WALTERONE_PASSWORD=YourPassword
```

This file is going to be used in the next steps.

## Skeleton test
You have an example of what a player should look like in `players_module/tests/test_players.py`.

If you configured the environment variables in the `.env` file correctly, you can run the tests with the following command:

```commandline
python players_module/walterplayers/skeleton.py --env .env
```
You must see the following output:

```commandline
> python  walterplayers/skeleton_player.py --env .env
